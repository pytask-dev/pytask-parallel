______________________________________________________________________

Parallelize the execution of tasks with `pytask-parallel` which is a plugin for
[pytask](https://github.com/pytask-dev/pytask).

## Installation

pytask-parallel is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pytask-parallel) and
[Anaconda.org](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pytask-parallel). Install it with

```console
$ pip install pytask-parallel

# or

$ conda install -c conda-forge pytask-parallel
```

By default, the plugin uses `concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor`.

It is also possible to select the executor from loky or `ThreadPoolExecutor` from the
[concurrent.futures](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html) module
as backends to execute tasks asynchronously.

## Usage

To parallelize your tasks across many workers, pass an integer greater than 1 or
`'auto'` to the command-line interface.

```console
$ pytask -n 2
$ pytask --n-workers 2

# Starts os.cpu_count() - 1 workers.
$ pytask -n auto
```

Using processes to parallelize the execution of tasks is useful for CPU bound tasks such
as numerical computations. ([Here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/868577/7523785) is an
explanation on what CPU or IO bound means.)

For IO bound tasks, tasks where the limiting factor are network responses, access to
files, you can parallelize via threads.

```console
$ pytask --parallel-backend threads
```

You can also set the options in a `pyproject.toml`.

```toml
# This is the default configuration. Note that, parallelization is turned off.

[tool.pytask.ini_options]
n_workers = 1
parallel_backend = "processes"  # or loky or threads
```

## Some implementation details

### Parallelization and Debugging

It is not possible to combine parallelization with debugging. That is why `--pdb` or
`--trace` deactivate parallelization.

If you parallelize the execution of your tasks using two or more workers, do not use
`breakpoint()` or `import pdb; pdb.set_trace()` since both will cause exceptions.

### Threads and warnings

Capturing warnings is not thread-safe. Therefore, warnings cannot be captured reliably
when tasks are parallelized with `--parallel-backend threads`.

## Changes

Consult the [release notes](CHANGES.md) to find out about what is new.

## Development

- `pytask-parallel` does not call the `pytask_execute_task_protocol` hook
  specification/entry-point because `pytask_execute_task_setup` and
  `pytask_execute_task` need to be separated from `pytask_execute_task_teardown`. Thus,
  plugins which change this hook specification may not interact well with the
  parallelization.

- There are two PRs for CPython which try to re-enable setting custom reducers which
  should have been working, but does not. Here are the references.
